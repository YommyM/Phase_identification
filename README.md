*Figure: Overview of the unsupervised method for lipid phase recognition.*

In this work, we developed an **unsupervised method** to recognize coexisting phases not only in lipid mixtures but also in **protein-containing bilayers**.  

Our method:
- Maps bilayer properties (atomic density) to **pixels** on the membrane plane.  
- Uses a **uniform strategy** to define the threshold \( \theta^\* \) for discriminating between the two phases (rather than assuming a fixed global threshold); 
- Maps pixel phase states back to **lipids**.  

This strategy is **independent of bilayer composition and temperature**, avoiding system-specific artifacts.  
The method shows improved **accuracy and robustness** compared to other methods such as **HMM**, and can characterize **dynamic phase transformations** even in the presence of **membrane proteins**.
